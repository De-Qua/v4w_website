"""
Library to handle the weights that will be used in the search of the shortest
path.
All the functions return an edge property with the required weights.
For each function the only required input is the graph, all the other arguments
are optional, nonetheless some of the arguments are crucial for determining the
weight, therefore in that case a custom value should be used.

Properties of graph_street are the following:
latlon         (vertex)  (type: vector<double>)
accessible     (edge)    (type: int32_t)
avg_tide       (edge)    (type: double)
geometry       (edge)    (type: python::object)
length         (edge)    (type: double)
max_tide       (edge)    (type: double)
med_tide       (edge)    (type: double)
min_tide       (edge)    (type: double)

street_id      (edge)    (type: double)

Properties of graph_water are the following:
